# Life-Expectancy-GDP-repo
 This Life Expectancy/GDP project was meant to find out if there's a relationship between the Life expectancy in a nation against it's GDP.
 Our dataset had six countries, Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA and Zimbabwe
 What we found out was that there is a relationship between a country's GDP and it's life expectancy. We also measured the correlation using SciPy and found out there is some correlation, although it was week. The weak correlation can be attributed to the variation of the GDP among the nations in the dataset.
