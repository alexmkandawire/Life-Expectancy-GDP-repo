# Life-Expectancy-GDP-repo
 This Life Expectancy/GDP project was meant to find out if there's a relationship between the Life expectancy in a nation against it's GDP.
 Our dataset had six countries, Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA and Zimbabwe
 What we found out was that there is a relationship between a country's GDP and it's life expectancy, however it is very weak for most of the nations.
